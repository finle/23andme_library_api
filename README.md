23andme_library_api

Objective:
==========
The objective of this assignment is to build a console line application with the data that you get from the google books api.
We will be using a simple unauthenticated google books api to get a list of books. And build a library with these books.
Please adhere to good coding practices and code quality.

===
Go ahead and copy paste this link https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=python on any web browser and see what it returns.
This API can also take additional parameter like https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=python&maxResults=40
More information about the API can be found here https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/volumes/list or by just googling in general.

Requirements:
============
1. The console line app should prompt the user for a search string and based on the input string the app must build the library. Please stick to popular search strings like 'dogs','cats','New York'... etc.
2. The app user must be able to save and persist the book/library data in csv file format.
3. Ability to at least sort the books by price, avg rating, rating count, published date, page count
4. The app should be able to save to and load from a csv file.
5. Bonus points for additional interesting and creative features not listed here. (Nice to see, but not required)

Tests:
============
Please include tests to cover your work.
